What is this RPG Game?
This is a simple coding project that is a text-based RPG game. It has simple movement controls, interactions with monsters, and randomized attack patterns based on the gameboy Pokemon game. It uses the terminal to display output and was developed on the MacOS. It functions in an enclosed map and can infinitely generate new monsters with scaling stats based on user level.
